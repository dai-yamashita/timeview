Designed by Stephen Few, a bullet chart “provides a rich display of data in a
small space.” A variation on a bar chart, bullet charts compare a given
quantitative measure (such as profit or revenue) against qualitative ranges
(e.g., poor, satisfactory, good) and related markers (e.g., the same measure a
year ago).
